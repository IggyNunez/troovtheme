When Troov is produced, it is a bright red color from the fermented beets. However, overtime that color turns slightly brown. This is due to the beet pigments which are unstable and sensitive to thermal processing. During the pasteurization process of Troov, the beetroot cells start to break down and the color gradually diminishes overtime. This does not effect the efficacy or taste of the drink, but it does effect the color."}},"d3941cfc-4d88-4638-b0e6-a187f13b44bf":{"type":"tab","settings":{"title":"Why does the bottle have sediment at the bottom?","body":"Troov features 1590mg of maca root which is not water soluble.

It’s a naturally produced molecule in your body that’s incredibly important to so many aspects of your health and wellness. Most importantly (and if you only remember one thing), it has a huge impact on vasodilation. That means it relaxes the inner muscles of the blood vessels, making them wider, increasing circulation.<\/p>\n<p>When we zoom out, we see that nitric oxide production is crucial to overall bodily health because it allows blood, nutrients, and oxygen to freely (and efficiently) travel through every part of your body.<\/p>\n<p>When your body isn’t able to readily produce nitric oxide, we see a correlation to increased heart disease, diabetes, and erectile dysfunction.<\/p>\n<p>At about 40-45 years old, our bodies stop producing as much nitric oxide so it’s important to increase supplementation. We specifically created TROOV as a tool for enhancing your body’s nitric oxide pathway. Our TROOVecta blend consists of green tea, fermented beets, and L-Citrulline to synergistically help you perform your very best.<\/p>\n<h4>Are the nitrates in this product bad for me?<\/h4>\n<p>No! We get that elemental nitrates have a bad rap (and they should) but the nitrates we use are completely different. Ours are derived from nature and are crucial to optimizing your health.

Our TROOVecta blend is probably where this shines the most as it consists of green tea, fermented beetroot, and L-Citrulline.
